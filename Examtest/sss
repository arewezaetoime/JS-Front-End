2. Contact List
Environment Specifics
Please be aware that every JS environment may behave differently when executing code. Certain things that work in the browser are not supported in Node.js, which is the environment used by Judge.
The following actions are NOT supported:
.forEach() with NodeList (returned by querySelector() and querySelectorAll())
.forEach() with HTMLCollection (returned by getElementsByClassName() and element.children)
using the spread-operator (...) to convert a NodeList into an array
append() (use only appendChild())
prepend()
replaceWith()
replaceAll()
closest()
replaceChildren()
If you want to perform these operations, you may use Array.from() to first convert the collection into an array. 
Use the provided skeleton to solve this problem.
Note: You can't and you have no permission to change directly the given HTML code (index.html file).
